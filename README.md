### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sepehr, I am a software engineer in love with games. I love creating game servers and optimizing codes. 
Some things I love and I work/play with are Python, Cython, Go, C++, Rust, JS, Lua, Unity, Godot, Rabbitmq, Postgresql and etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a multiplayer game.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- âš¡ Fun fact: If you leave me by my own, you might find me embedding lua and python in some Rust and C++ codes ...
